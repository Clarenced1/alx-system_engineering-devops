Postmortem of Egwal Services System

Date and Time of Incident: 5th May, 2023: 7:00am
Duration of Incident: 6th May, 2023

Summary:
On 5th May, 2023 at 7:00am, an outage occurred in the web stack debugging project, resulting in service disruption for users. This postmortem aims to provide a detailed analysis of the incident, its root causes, the steps taken to mitigate the issue, and the measures put in place to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Incident Timeline:
5th May, 2023: 7:05am - Reports of service degradation and errors start to surface.
5th May, 2023: 7:15am - The engineering team is alerted to the ongoing outage and initiates investigations.
5th May, 2023: 7:30am - Initial assessment reveals increased error rates and slower response times.
5th May, 2023: 8:00am - The team identifies that the database server is experiencing high CPU utilization.
5th May, 2023: 10:00am - Further analysis indicates a sudden surge in incoming requests and a database query optimization issue.
5th May, 2023: 11:00am - The decision is made to temporarily scale up the database resources to mitigate the high CPU usage.
5th May, 2023: 12:00pm - Database scaling is successfully implemented, and error rates start to decrease.
5th May, 2023: 2:00pm - The root cause of the query optimization issue is identified and a fix is developed.
5th May, 2023: 7:00pm - The fix is tested in a controlled environment and deployed to the production environment.
6th May, 2023: 1:00am - Service stability is fully restored and error rates return to normal.

Root Causes:
Sudden Surge in Traffic: An unexpected increase in incoming traffic resulted in a sudden load spike on the web servers and database.
Database Query Optimization: A suboptimal database query was discovered, causing excessive CPU usage and slower response times.

Mitigation Steps:
Temporary Database Scaling: To alleviate the high CPU utilization, the decision was made to temporarily scale up the database resources.
Rate Limiting: Implemented rate limiting on incoming requests to prevent the servers from becoming overwhelmed.
Query Optimization Fix: Developed and deployed a fix for the database query optimization issue.
Performance Monitoring: Implemented enhanced monitoring to quickly identify unusual spikes in traffic and resource utilization.
Preventive Measures:
Auto-Scaling: Implement an auto-scaling mechanism to dynamically adjust resources based on incoming traffic.
Query Performance Review: Regularly review and optimize database queries to prevent similar performance issues.
Load Testing: Conduct thorough load testing to identify system limitations and ensure sufficient capacity.
Incident Response Plan: Refine and document a clear incident response plan for quick and efficient resolution.
Redundancy and Failover: Set up redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure service availability during server failures.

Communication:
Regular updates were provided to users via social media, email, and the website's status page.
An internal communication channel was established to keep the engineering team informed throughout the incident and resolution process.

Conclusion:
The web stack debugging project outage was caused by a combination of unexpected traffic spikes and a database query optimization issue. Swift actions were taken to mitigate the issue, restore service stability, and implement preventive measures to avoid future occurrences. The incident has highlighted the importance of proactive monitoring, efficient incident response, and continuous optimization of the system's performance.
We apologize for any inconvenience caused and remain committed to delivering a reliable and robust service.
